# =========================================================
# Unity Project Git LFS Configuration
# Tracks large binary files using Git Large File Storage (LFS)
# This prevents the main Git repository from becoming too large and slow.
# =========================================================

# 1. Unity Core Binary Files (.unity, .prefab, .asset, .mat)
# These are scene files, prefabs, scriptable objects, and materials.
# They change frequently and are always binary.
*.unity filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.prefab filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.asset filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.mat filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# NOTE on .meta: While often tracked by LFS, the standard practice is to
# treat them as text for easier merging, but since they can be complex,
# some teams choose to track them as binary:
*.meta filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# 2. 3D Model Files
# All common 3D model formats used for environment and Agent bodies.
*.fbx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.obj filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.max filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.dae filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# 3. Image and Texture Files
# Large textures should be stored in LFS for efficiency.

# 4. Audio and Video Files
