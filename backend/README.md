**Paprika** is an experimental AI Agent framework designed to simulate embodied cognition in a 3D environment. It decouples the **"Brain"** (a LangGraph-based Python backend) from the **"Body"** (Unity Engine), allowing agents to learn, plan, and execute complex procedural tasks (like cooking) through a WebSocket bridge.
